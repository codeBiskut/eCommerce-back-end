  # E-commerce Back-End   

  ## Description
  ---

  This project is the back-end side of an e-commerce platform. Since e-commerce platforms and sites are extremely prevalent, it would serve developers well to further their understanding of them through projects like this one. I took a working Express.js API, and reconfigured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Installation
  ---

  You will need MySQL set up on your computer to run this application. First, clone the repo into a destination of your choosing. Assuming you have MySQL installed, navigate to the .env.EXAMPLE and insert your credentials (with ecommerce_db as the database) and then rename the file to .env. Run npm install to install all of the required dependencies.   

  ## Usage
  ---

  To use, first use the command mysql -u root -p and login to your MySQL server. Type 'source db/schema.sql' to set up the tables in MySQL, then type 'quit'. Type 'npm run seed' to seed the example data into the tables you just created. Then, type 'npm start' to start the server. Use in combination with Insomnia, or any other API client or design platform.
